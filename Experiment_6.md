# Current mirror Circuit
**why current mirror circuit is more preferred than tail current Source in differential amplifier?**
A current mirror circuit is preferred over a simple tail current source in a differential amplifier because it provides a more stable and precise current. Unlike a resistor-based tail current source, which is affected by power supply variations and temperature changes, a current mirror maintains a constant current, improving the amplifierâ€™s common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and overall performance. This stability helps in rejecting noise and ensuring the differential amplifier functions reliably under varying conditions.
Additionally, a current mirror ensures better symmetry and matching, which is essential for proper differential amplifier operation. It provides higher output resistance, making it a more ideal current source while also consuming less power compared to a resistor-based tail source. Since a simple tail current source requires a high-value resistor and high supply voltage, it results in increased power dissipation. In contrast, a current mirror circuit delivers greater precision, stability, and efficiency, making it the preferred choice in high-performance differential amplifier designs.
## Aim: - Design and analyze current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit.
## Procedure: -
1.	Design the Circuit as per the circuit in fig circuit 1 and put appropriate values of the resistor and W/L value of MOSFET.
2.	For simulation in LT spice first select DC operating point simulate the circuit find current (I out) compare from Iref and note down in tabular column 1. vary the W/L and analyze the I out.
